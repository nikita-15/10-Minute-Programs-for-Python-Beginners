PROJECT - 1

This Python Program will enable you to count the number of words in a web page, to print out the top 'n' most frequently used words, and also to find the number of times a particular word appears on the page.

Why?

1. To find out if we need to log in or not (many scam websites require you to sign in)
2. To find out the category of the website
3. To get information on audience profiles.
4. Translators like to know the number of words that they need to translate in order to decide their price (on a per word basis).
5. A writer can use this information to help make their own website or blog better, by counting the number of words in another popular writer's website, in order to know what type of articles are most liked by readers.
6. You can even improve your website by checking what number of words are most preferred by the audience, and following that to increase your popularity.
7. This is just a simple practise program, of course, and once you understand this, you can move a step higher and learn how to perform much more complicated programs for website crawling.


PROJECT - 2

This is a very basic Python Program to understand the concept of NLP (Natural Language Processing) using a similar set of Codes as in Project-1. Here, we find out what a webpage is talking about, by counting the 'n' most frequently used words in it. Practically, this will not always give us a 100% accurate answer, but we may at least get the jist of the web page's content. This project contains 2 Methods, and a little more detail, compared to the previous one.


PROJECT - 3

This is a Python Program that will help you understand the basics of Sentiment Analysis. It is very simple, and requires only one main library. Through this Program, we can determine whether a statement is a positive one, or a negative one.
